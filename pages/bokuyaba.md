description: A review of manga and anime series "The Dangers in My Heart"
title: Otaku rant
---

I've caught up with the manga, and finished the second season of the anime yesterday.

In the digital age, where content is king and the competition for attention is fierce, the art of storytelling faces both unprecedented challenges and opportunities.
School romance-themed anime, in particular, is a genre that has seen a surge in popularity and also, a saturation of content.

- Girlfriend, Girlfriend
- My Dress-Up Darling
- Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie
- ...

It's not that these series are bad; in fact, many of them are quite enjoyable.
But the sheer volume of similar stories can make it difficult for any one series to stand out.

The key to success in this saturated market is not just in the telling,
but in the crafting of tales that weave together the timeless elements of classic storytelling with the tools of modern day.
It's about understanding the pulse of the audience, then delivering stories that are not only heard but felt.

"The Dangers in My Heart" follows a path that might initially seem conventional.
However, what sets it apart is the nuanced storytelling, the interactions between the protagonists,
the unfiltered, intricate exploration of Ichikawa's thought processes,
and the subtle, but gradually prominent changes in Yamada's behavior.
While these elements might not have been as distinctly highlighted in the manga (they are in there tho, it's just harder to notice comparing with the anime adoption),
the anime adaptation brings them to the forefront with remarkable clarity and depth.
The focus on characters' thoughts and emotions and words left unsaid, makes the story feel more real and relatable.
Not those of idealized characters, but of flawed, complex individuals navigating the complexities of their feelings and relationships.
That's where the series (both manga and anime) truly shines, without the need for grand gestures or dramatic plot twists or fan services. ;)

The sound design stands out as a particularly strong element in the anime adaptation.
It's hard to describe the impact of the background score and sound effects in words,
but at minimum, they did an amazing job complementing the emotional tone of the story,
enhancing pivotal moments and creating a strong emotional connection with the audience.
Maybe I'm biased, but hearing [Setting Sun by Yorushika](https://youtu.be/bqigIHMComE?si=jL7YhzVYGuZ3KGRG) playing at the end of second season almost made me cry.

Out of all those anime series I've watched (in the lower three digits range),
I'm putting "The Dangers in My Heart" in my top 10 list.
It's a series that stands out in the sea of sameness,
an example of what can be achieved when the balance of plot, character development, and emotional depth is just right.
