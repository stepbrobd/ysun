description: Be your own ISP! Getting your own ASN and IP address blocks with RIR is surprisingly not too difficult, I got AS10779 from ARIN without hustle
title: AS10779

This is a small network, no external services will be provided.

- Regional Internet Registry: [ARIN](https://www.arin.net)
- AS Number: [10779](https://rdap.arin.net/registry/autnum/10779)
- Networks
  - [23.161.104.0/24](https://rdap.arin.net/registry/ip/23.161.104.0)

## Peering

Peering ([PeeringDB](/peeringdb)) is open to anyone meeting following criteria:

- All peers must maintain a 24/7 contactable NOC
- We reserve the right to suspend peering for an indefinite period of time for
  any kind of abuse, DDoS, etc.
- Peers are encouraged to provide access to a Looking Glass to facilitate
  troubleshooting
- Peers should not point a gateway of last resort or default route directed
  towards our session
- The use of a mutually agreed BGP session password is encouraged but not
  required
- All announced routes must be covered by a valid ROA

## Nix + Bird2

Since `nixpkgs` has
[Bird2 options](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&show=services.bird2.enable),
it's relatively simple to make a config that can be reused for multiple peers:

```nix
{ ... }:

{
  services.bird2.config =
    let
      peer = [
        {
          name = "<Peer Name>";
          asn = "<Peer ASN>";
          ipv4 = "<Peer IPv4>";
          ipv6 = "<Peer IPv6>";
          multihop = "<Multihop>";
          password = "<BGP Password>";
        }
        { ... }
      ];
    in
    ''
      ${lib.concatMapStringsSep "\n" (p: ''
        protocol bgp ${p.name}4 {
          // own ipv4, asn
          graceful restart on;
          multihop ${p.multihop};
          neighbor ${p.ipv4}
          as ${p.asn};
          password "${p.password}";
          ipv4 {
            import filter {
              // import filters
              accept;
            };
            export filter {
              // export filters
              accept;
            };
          };
        }
      '') peer}

      ${lib.concatMapStringsSep "\n" (p: ''
        protocol bgp ${p.name}6 {
          // own ipv6, asn
          graceful restart on;
          multihop ${p.multihop};
          neighbor ${p.ipv6}
          as ${p.asn};
          password "${p.password}";
          ipv6 {
            import filter {
              // import filters
              accept;
            };
            export filter {
              // export filters
              accept;
            };
          };
        }
      '') peer}
    '';
}
```
