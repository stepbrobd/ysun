Photo dump from a day trip to 本栖湖 (Lake Motosu).

Lake Motosu is actually quite hard to get to by train. After some digging, I
opted to take a seasonal highway bus from Shinjuku to Lake Motosu (around ¥2000
and 2.5 hours one way).

For those who are interested in going to Lake Motosu, be sure to check the
weather forecast and the bus schedule. The bus only runs **two** times a day,
and the last bus leaves around 4:20 PM (as of Aug. 2024).

If you can get your DL translated to Japanese, I would 100% recommend renting a
car and drive there. They have prefectural-run parking lots and private lots. A
lot of surfers just park their cars along Yamanashi Prefectural Route 709.
