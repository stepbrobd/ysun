I'm a MSCS student at Northeastern University.
I have the fortune to be advised by Dr. [Ji-Yong Shin](https://www.jiyongshin.info) at [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu).
I visited [Computing Software Group](https://www.csg.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) advised by Dr. [Tomoharu Ugawa](https://tugawa.github.io/index-e.html) at University of Tokyo during the summer of 2024.
I finished my undergrad at University of Utah under the guidance of Dr. [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and co-advisor Dr. [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

I'm generally interested in system and theory ([CV](/cv)), topics include:

- Verifications on consistency semantical constraints in distributed systems.
- Constructive type theory and mechanized proofs.
- [Reproducible (build) systems](https://reproducible-builds.org).

My contact info is hidden within the [source code of this site](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Astepbrobd%2Fysun+%22hidden%3A+true%22+%22external%3A+https%3A%2F%2F%22+%22layout%3A+redirect.vto%22&type=code).

You can reach me directly with [Matrix](/matrix), Discord (use my GitHub username), or email (`echo -n 'eXN1bkBoZXkuY29tCg==' | base64 --decode`).

I ride a Trek Fuel EX 5 for fun and commute, and I daily-drive a Framework Laptop 13 with NixOS and a 14-inch MacBook Pro on the go.
I own and operate [AS10779](/10779) ([PeeringDB](/peeringdb)) with two IP assignments from ARIN.
I maintain [about 15 packages](https://repology.org/maintainers/?search=ysun%40hey.com) and [actively](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=involves%3Astepbrobd) contribute to the Nix ecosystem.
During my free time, I enjoy swimming, [cycling](/strava), archery, and playing [osu!](/osu) (mostly mania and std with Wacom Intuos Pro).
Streaming services? Apple Music all the way ([playlist](/music))!

Troll: I can't stand s-expressions, but Emacs Lisp gets a free pass (cause it's actually useful).
I dislike Racket so much that I even made a [website](https://rkt.lol) and a [poster](https://rkt.lol/poster.pdf) about it.
