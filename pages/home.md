I am a PhD student at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr) [DataMove Team](https://team.inria.fr/datamove) under [Olivier Richard](https://datamove.imag.fr/olivier.richard) and co-advised by [Christian Perez](https://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~cperez/web/doku.php/start) ([Avalon Team](https://avalon.ens-lyon.fr)).
I graduated from Northeastern University with MSCS where I had the fortune to be advised by [Ji-Yong Shin](https://www.jiyongshin.info) at [Systems Research Group](https://srg.khoury.northeastern.edu).
I visited [Computing Software Group](https://www.csg.ci.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) advised by [Tomoharu Ugawa](https://tugawa.github.io/index-e.html) at University of Tokyo during the summer of 2024.
I finished my undergrad at University of Utah under the guidance of [Shad Roundy](https://iss.mech.utah.edu/shad-roundy) and co-advisor [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).

I'm generally interested in system and theory ([CV](/cv)), topics include:

- Verifications on consistency semantical constraints in distributed systems.
- Constructive type theory and mechanized proofs.
- [Reproducible (build) system](https://reproducible-builds.org) in HPC environments.

![Weekend outing with labmates (Walden Pond)](/assets/static/img/home-1.avif)

I ride a Trek Fuel EX 5 for fun and commute, and I daily-drive a Framework Laptop 13 with NixOS and a 14-inch MacBook Pro on the go.
I own and operate [AS10779](/10779) ([PeeringDB](/peeringdb), [looking glass](https://bgp.tools/lg/10779)) with two IP assignments from ARIN.
I maintain [about 150 packages](https://repology.org/maintainers/?search=ysun%40hey.com) and [actively](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?q=involves%3Astepbrobd) contribute to the Nix ecosystem.
During my free time, I enjoy swimming, [cycling](/strava), archery, and playing [osu!](/osu) (mostly mania and std with Wacom Intuos Pro).
Streaming services? Apple Music all the way ([playlist](/music))!

Troll: I can't stand s-expressions, but Emacs Lisp gets a free pass (cause it's actually useful).
I dislike Racket so much that I even made a [website](https://rkt.lol) and a [poster](https://rkt.lol/poster.pdf) about it.
