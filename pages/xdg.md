description: Tired of cluttered home directory? A call to action to follow the XDG Base Directory Specification
title: XDG

The
[XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
is not some new thing, it's been around for a while. Writing a new project? Use
it. Updating an old project? Use it. It's not hard to implement, and it's not
hard to use.

This is super easy to implement, you probably don't even need a library. But if
you are lazy:
